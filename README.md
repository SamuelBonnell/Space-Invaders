# Space-Invaders
Summary:
This game was created for ECE 287 with Peter Jamieson at Miami University. The game we created is a version of Space Invaders. You are a ship at the bottom of the screen who has to shoot a group of aliens that are systematically moving down the screen towards you. The ship is only able to move left or right and can fire only a single bullet at a time. If an Alien reaches the bottom, then you die and lose the game. We created 15 aliens that you will have to shoot before they reach the bottom. IF the ship shoots all of the aliens before they reach the bottom then you win, but if not then you lose.
